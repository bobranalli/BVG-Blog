							<h3><u>Opera GX</u></h3>
						</div>
						<br>
						This week we are going to take a look at the Opera GX – “the first browser built for gamers.” Opera GX is a special version of the Opera browser. If you’re unfamiliar with Opera, it is a chromium-based web browser that is used by 2-3% of people (whereas Chrome is about 80%). Opera was also the company that developed web browsers for the Nintendo DS and Wii. Many years later, Opera is once again coming to the aid of gamers everywhere with their new browser “Opera GX.” The browser runs on both Windows 10 and macOS and is intended to help gamers optimize the power distribution of their laptops when they have a browser open.
						<br><br>
						Opera GX offers some very interesting and unique features. For instance, ambient, electronic, non-vocal, music plays that dynamically changes based on what you’re doing. If you are typing furiously or if you’re quickly switching between tabs, the music picks up just like a battle scene in a video game. But if you’re just scrolling casually, similarly to if you were just foraging in a video game, the music is softer and more mellow. Luckily, if this sounds annoying to you, you can just switch off the audio and it will go back to performing like a normal browser.
						<br><br>
						Opera GX has a long list of features but there are a few that stand out the most – GX Control being one of them. GX Control is found on a side panel of the browser that allows you to see which tabs are requiring the most amount of CPU or RAM and allows you to limit the bandwidth your browser is using. On top of that, there is a RAM and CPU limiter so you can control the amount of “effort” your computer is putting towards your browser. This is wildly important when you’re playing a large-scale triple-A game where you want every ounce of your CPU running towards the game, but still giving people the ability to keep their browser open to stream Twitch, play music, etc. GX Control is a highly differentiating feature that acts as a built-in task manager to give gamers the ability to take control of their CPU and RAM usage. Opera GX presents you with data to help identify potential performance problems and provides the tools and options to fix them. When comparing Opera GX to Chrome, the world’s most popular browser, Opera GX takes up about half as much memory as Chrome when both have the same exact tabs and windows open.
						<br><br>
						Another interesting feature of Opera GX, is the GX Corner – a social media like hub for all things gaming. There is a page dedicated to posting new game releases with dates and a calendar feature showing the release dates and trailers accompanying them. It also shows gaming news articles for all popular games and for games that you choose to follow. There is also a Deals Aggregator section which shows when games will go on sale, shows a list of which games are free. When using Opera GX on mobile, the GX Corner displays news and sales relating to mobile games. For both platforms, mobile and desktop, the GX Corner connects you directly to stores where you can purchase games – like Steam, Epic Games, Stadia.
						<br><br>
						On top of all that, Opera GX has a built-in VPN and Ad Blocker. The built-in VPN provides users with a virtual IP address that helps hide location. This allows for users to feel safe when browsing and helps them secure their internet traffic.  Overall, I can see Opera GX becoming very popular in gaming communities. They have many features, like optimizing CPU and RAM usage, which fit into the gaming niche very well. The UI also fits the typical “gaming” aesthetic of looking futuristic and sleek.
