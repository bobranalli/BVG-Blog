							<h3><u>THANK YOU</u></h3>
						</div>
						<br>
						With my 12th and final blog post I just wanted to say thank you for a great semester! I learned a lot and had a lot of fun. The class structure was great, and I think the weekly blog posts were one of my favorite parts of the class. I liked the freedom to write about anything within the video games industry, sometimes being able to focus on specific games, or game engines, and other times talking about funding and indie development in general.
						<br><br>
						One of my favorite lectures of the year was the marketing one – I thought it was interesting how different studios, consoles, and games choose to market. The have to consider what streams and platforms to engage with their audience. The difference in personal engagement on social media and blog posts between an indie developer and a large studio. The message the advertisements want to give off and how it relates to the gameplay itself. My other favorite lecture was the leadership panel. The insights the four of them had was very cool to see. I would have loved to spend more time asking them questions, especially Dave Horn and Chris Zimmerman who have spent years making and developing games. If you can get Chris Zimmerman back again next year, that would be my main recommendation. Having a big name in the industry speak was very engaging and motivating. As someone who wants to develop a game, getting to hear advice from someone like him was invaluable.
						<br><br>
						Thank you again for the great semester, Zach! I look forward to keeping in touch and seeing how your class develops over the next few years and semesters. If you ever need any testimonials for your class, please don’t hesitate to ask.
