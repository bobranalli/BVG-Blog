							<h3><u>Undertale</u></h3>
						</div>
						<br><br>
						This week, continuing on the trend of video games developed by a single
						person, we are going to look at “Undertale” a 2D-roleplaying game developed
						solely by Toby Fox in 2015. If you haven’t played the game, the gameplay
						is centered around you, a child who has fallen into the Underground
						who is looking to make it back to the surface. Through your travels
						you meet monsters, some friendly, some who you must fight in a “bullet
						curtain” or “bullet-hell” style. The game contains small puzzles for
						the user to complete, mazes, and many battles to partake in. If you’re
						a fan of the role-playing game Dungeon and Dragons and want to get into
						a new video game, this might the one for you. As you move through the
						Underground you encounter many scenarios where you get to decide what
						happens and what direction you go in. One interesting aspect of the
						game is that the player never speaks, and most of the game’s narration
						is in second person. This allows for the player to identify with the
						character more and act as if it is themselves in the Underworld,
						not a pre-set/predetermined character.
						<br><br>
						Tony Fox developed this game in 32 months after it was funded on Kickstarter.
						Although the original goal was $5,000, the Kickstarter raised over $50,000.
						Tony started development with the battle system, inspired by the Mario and
						Luigi series, and created the game using GameMaker: Studio. Like many of the
						developers we have looked at over the weeks, Tony made every part of the game
						(with artist Temmie Chang providing character sprites and concept art). Tony
						worked as the programmer, storywriter, and composer. He was inspired by many
						games during the creation of Undertale, a few of which being Brandish, Shin
						Megami Tensei, and Moon: Remix RPG Adventure.
						<br><br>
						When questioned about the simplistic art style of the game Tony said
						he found that "there's a psychological thread that says audiences become
						more attached to characters drawn simply rather than in detail." Because
						of this Tony and Temmie kept the art style a simple, even to the point
						of the battle simulation being in black and white.
						<br><br>
						Tony also introduces humor into the game, an example being Toriel, the
						tutorial character. Toriel is a wildly overly protective and overbearing
						mother-like character who quite literally holds your hand through part of
					  the game. This was inspired by the partner character Fi in Skyward Sword
					  who would give the main character answers to the puzzles. Tony said in
						an interview – “I figured that if someone was THAT concerned about you
						then they wouldn’t tell you the answers, they would just do the puzzles
						and fight all the monsters FOR you. This is why she literally holds your
						hand through a segment of the game.”
						<br><br>
						If you’re looking for a game with interesting battle mechanics, a deep,
						grim, and engaging storyline, and a diverse set of player interactions,
						I would highly recommend you go check out Undertale. You can expect about
						6 hours of gameplay for a basic playthrough, but somewhere closer to 20
						hours if you want to complete all the available side quests and puzzles.
