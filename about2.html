							That's definitely me on the left there. A little about myself, my name is
							Bob and I am a junior at Tufts studying computer science. My main hobbies
							are lifting, screenplay writing, hiking, and occasionnally trying to convince
							my girlfried I know how to breakdance (I can't but don't tell her that). I
							made this blog for my Business of Video Games class taught by Zach. I hope
							whoever reads this likes it. Maybe I'll make a comment section for people to
							roast my shitty code.
